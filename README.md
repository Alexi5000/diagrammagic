## 🎨 Template System

### How It Works

1. **Template Library**: 12 pre-built diagrams in `src/data/templates.ts`
2. **Navigation**: Click "Use Template" → `/editor?template={id}`
3. **Loading**: Editor reads URL param and loads matching template
4. **Validation**: Automated tests verify templates on every build

### Debugging Template Issues

**Open browser console and look for:**

✅ **Success Flow:**
```
✅ Templates module loaded {totalTemplates: 12, ...}
🎨 TemplateCard: User clicked "Use Template" {templateId: "tpl-business-funnel-003"}
🔍 Editor: URL params checked {templateId: "tpl-business-funnel-003"}
🎨 Editor: Loading template {totalTemplatesAvailable: 12}
✅ Editor: Template found and loaded {name: "Sales Funnel Pipeline", codeLength: 847}
```

❌ **Failure Flow:**
```
❌ Editor: Template not found {requestedId: "invalid-id", availableIds: [...]}
```

### Adding New Templates

1. Add to `templates` array in `src/data/templates.ts`
2. Use format: `tpl-{category}-{name}-{number}`
3. Include all required fields (id, name, description, code, type, category, difficulty)
4. Run tests: `npm run test`
5. Verify in browser console: Look for template ID in startup logs
